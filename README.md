# Nx proves JavaScript is Dead ðŸ’€

## Setup

*Prerequisites:*
- [Node](https://nodejs.org) 20.6+
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com)
- [NativeScript](https://beta.docs.nativescript.org/setup/): if you want to develop iOS and Android apps.

```bash
yarn
```

## Develop Analog Web App

```bash
yarn nx run web-store:serve
```

## Develop iOS and Android Apps

```bash
yarn nx run nativescript-store:ios

yarn nx run nativescript-store:android
```

## Ready to deploy?

The web app can be hosted with any hosting provider and the iOS and Android apps could be packaged for App Store distributions.

#### Build Web:

```bash
yarn nx run web-store:build
```

The app could now be deployed to any web hosting providers. 


#### Build iOS:

```bash
yarn nx run nativescript-store:build --platform=ios
```

The app could now be uploaded to TestFlight by Archive and Upload in Xcode (`open apps/nativescript-store/platforms/ios/nativescriptstore.xcworkspace`)

#### Build Android:

```bash
yarn nx run nativescript-store:build --platform=android
```

A `.aab` file would be available inside `apps/nativescript-store/dist` for upload to Google Play.
